# Classic-CNN-
This is a description of classic convolutional neural network and its implementation in Pytorch <br>
We briefly introduce the structure and #params and FLOPs of these network

## 1. LeNet
LeNet, proposed in 1998 by LeCun, contains 7 layers including 2 conv, 2 pooling and 3 fc layers

## 2. AlexNet
AlexNet, proposed in 2012, contains 8 layers including 5 conv and 3 fc layers. <br>
tricks: ReLU <br>
        Dropout <br>
        Local Response Normalization <br>
        Overlapping Pooling
